Task 4 – Hypothesis Testing (A/B Testing)

This task involves performing hypothesis testing on an A/B testing dataset (ab_data.csv) to determine whether a new website design improved user conversions compared to the old version. The project began with data cleaning and preprocessing, including removing duplicates and missing entries to ensure reliable statistical analysis. Conversion rates for both the control and treatment groups were calculated and visualized to understand the overall performance difference between the two versions of the site.

A Two-Proportion Z-Test was conducted to compare the conversion rates and assess whether the difference observed between groups was statistically significant. To further analyze user behavior, a T-Test was performed to evaluate differences in session duration between the two groups, providing insights into engagement levels. Additionally, a Chi-Square Test was applied to study the relationship between the group type and the users’ country, helping identify whether location had any influence on conversions.

The results of these tests provided valuable evidence on whether the new design significantly improved conversions or if the observed differences were due to random variation. Through this analysis, data-driven conclusions were drawn to guide the decision on whether the updated design should be implemented across the website.
